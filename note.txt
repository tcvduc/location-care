Corpse 1: Get family's members location through mobile phone - mobile app 
- Get the person who you care location throught mobile phone - mobile app 

App name Ver 1: Location Care
App name Ver 2: 
- problem: 
+ App Name is too long 
+ The word Care is too reveal 
-> Solve this using Grab idea: one word - Grab 
- some english relative words:
+ location 
+ care 
+ look 
+ mobile phone 
+ observe 
+ map  
+ worry 
+ helper stuff to kill somebody 
+ a matrix 
+ baby learn to do stuff 
+ baby learn to join the system 
+ Flow  
  + stuff move through eye -> eye nerves -> brain nerves 
  + look something -> create electrical signal -> brain process system 

-> Temporary Result 1: Signal - should use verb for the active in the app essence?
-> Temporary Result 2: Sign  

-> Final App Name Ver 2 Result: 
What the app name should be? Later

+ App essence ? 
  -> look another person location through mobile phone 
+ Use verb or noun or another word type?
  ->  use any word type is okay as long as it
  describe the app eseence

I. User Experience
  1. What will happens if the app don't have the password field
  and only have phone input field? 
    - Cons 
    + User may see weird
    + App is not safety (1)
      + If any user got the phone number of another user 
      then they can access to the data 
        + What if user A got user B data
          + A can got those information:
            + B's phone number, name, address   
            + B's location look list  
                + Scenario 1: related to friendship
                  + Scenario 1.1: good intention
                    + B is A's friend
                    + B and A in a place where they drink ancohol
                    + B got drunk 
                    + A still awake
                    + A want to communicate B's family to let 
                    them know B status
                    -> A got B phone then A can do it by using 
                    this app, what a beauty scenario!

                    -> B will not be damaged

                  + Scenario 1.2: bad intention
                    + A want to kill B 
                    + This is a helper tool for this purpose
                    -> B will be dead or live a life with full of worries
                    + But the truth is if A really want to kill B 
                    A will find a way to do this if this tool is not exist
                    for example: buy data from Google, buy data from Facebook,
                    buy data from the trademark devices that B use like 
                    phone, television, washing machine, refrigerator, light bubls,
                    wires even home structure system. 
                    -> So this is not a reason to stop the remove password field
                                
                  + Scenario 1.3: neither good nor bad intention
                    + Because of the curious A just want to know B 
                    app data 
                    -> B will not be damaged
       
                + Scenario 2: related to employer and employee relationship
                  + Scenario 2.1: good intention
                    + A is a company/employer B are employees
                    + A want to know where B is, or just because
                    A want to taste the feeling when we
                    look somebody location through an application
                    -> B will not be damaged

                  + Scenario 2.2: bad intention
                    + A want to control B life
                    -> B will be damaged

                  + Scenario 2.3: good intention
                    + B is a employee who also have A employer location 
                    + B want to thank A for the good thing A did 
                    -> A,B will not be damaged  

                  + Scenario 2.4: bad intention
                    + B is a employee who also have A employer location 
                    + B want to harm A for the bad thing A did 
                    -> A,B will be damaged  
                     
                  -> This app is risky, those sapiens from this 
                  relationship to higher consciousness 
                  sapiens relationship may not use  

                + Scenario 3: Related to company and company relationship 
                  + A and B can watch each other location    
                  -> There is nothing hurt happen if A and B don't 
                  have bad intension 
           

                + Scenario 4: Related to country and country relationship 
                  + They will not use 

                + Scenario 5: Related to self-self relationship 
                + scenario 5.1: B is a person who will feel 
                  uncomfortable when B's location was known by other
                    -> B will not use this app 

                    + Why B worries about their location? 
                    - Because B can die any second if someone 
                    want to kill B                    
  
    - Pros 
    + Don't have to remember password
    + Short time to logged in 
    + User Interface more simplify  
    + Don't have password field <=> don't have register feature 
    - mental heath pros: 
    + Making our worry neuron cell become not worry neuron cell
    + Once we have not worry about things, we can do the things 
    we want. 
    + Was we do the thing we want make us happy?
    + We will not face the regret feeling 
    + Once our strong mental neuron connected, no body can 
    control us, we control ourself, our life 

    + The thing is we want to know where our children been   
    and don't have to remember the password because we 
    have a lot of things to do to make this 
    world becomes heaven = )), we don't have time to 
    think a way to harm other for what.  
   

    -> If somehow we can fix the (1) problem then
    we can remove the password field 
      + How to loggin only use phone number field but
      the app still safe? 

    -> Although we have a lot of negative things but 
    let's try to see what happens  

    -> Although we see that we have a really lot of 
    negative things but let's try to do something 
    to see what happens 

    -> It is too dangerous for user, you do this will harm them, stop 


  2. Common hand manipulation 
  2.1. Mobile Phone  
                         Phone 
                         -----
                         |   |
 Comfortable position ___|___|___ Comfortable position 
                         | o |    Touch the input field at first time
                         -----    when user put their finger on the phone 


  2.2. Ipad 
  2.2.1. Vertical position 
      -------
      |     |
      |     |
      |_   _|___ comfortable position 
      || o ||

    touch right there  __|[]    []|__ touch right there 
                         ----------
  3. Display Flag 
  - Flow: 
  + When user open the app, ask user to get the location 
    + if user allow then display the flag corresponding the country 
    + if user wasn't allow then what might happend ?
      + if display the USA(+1) country 
        + sleep sapiens will see nothing 
        + awake sapiens in another country may feel something bad 
      -> So what we gonna do?
        + display blank rectangle? - temporary solution
        
   
  4. Display too much red color 
  -> Don't display too much red color 
  -> Display red color in stuff like: app name, logo  

  5. App color 
  - The color represent for Day work, night have fun, sync with solar system color
    + Day color for Day 
    + Night color for night   

  + Black color damage our pupil
    -> Decreasing the black opacity 
    -> linear gradient color - use this

  6. The users use the app for kill somebody purpose 
  6.1. war 
  -> Just remove the app from the country 
  6.2. random sapiens 
  -> If a sapiens really want to kill somebody, there are a lot of ways to 
  do. 
  -> Learn privacy from Grab 


II. User Interface
 + sign in screen
    + Logo 
    + Name 
    + Phone Number Input Field 
    + Sign in button 
    
 + dashboard screen 

 + refer another app screen 



III. Tech 
1. Declare number/string/any-type value
+ Open app 
+ Variables use memory to live 
+ If variable have the same value then we should 
point it to the same place to save resources   

2. Import problem
2.1
+ On module A, import module B 
+ On module B, import module A 
-> Create infinity cycle import 

2.2
+ On module C, import module A, B  
+ On module C, export module A, B  

+ On module A/B, import module C 
-> Create infinity cycle import



 



IV. Todo
+ Replace all variables those have the same value by global variable 
+ App name font famlily
+ onboard canvas


V. Tech note

1. Typescript 
- *.d.ts file versus *.ts file versus *.tsx file

+ *.d.ts 
  + Typescript declaration file 
  + Typescript compiler scope 
  + This file let Typescript compiler know 
  if stuff was existed 
  + Example:
    + We have 
      function displayMessage(message) {
         alert(message)
      }
      outside the typescript compiler scope 
      -> Typescript compiler cannot read this 
      -> So we use *.d.ts to declare that 
    + Example
      + on types.d.ts
        + write 
          + declare function displayMessage(message:string);

+ *.ts file = standard file extension, it 
will be compiled to Javascript

+ *.tsx file 
  + React Typescript File
  + a *.ts file 
  + written using JSX syntax 

2. Typescript compiler 
- parse *.ts file to *.js file
  + npx tsc file.ts 

3. JSX 
+ JSX: Javascript XML 
+ JSX allow us to write HTML in React 
- Example:
+ const element = <h1>I love JSX!</h1>


4. XML 
+ XML: Extensible Marup Language 
+ XML is similar to HTML, but without predefined 
tag to use  
+ In XML we define our own tags specifically 
for our need
- Example:
<?xml version = "1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<message>
 <warning>
  Hello World 
 </warning>
</message> 

5. Android Studio tools 
+ https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/ 
+ How to open Appearance & Behavior 
  + More action -> SDK Manager -> SDK tools
+ Android SDK Location: C:\Users\LENOVO\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
+ ADV: Android Virtual Device

6. Figma tools 
6.1. How to open web console 
  + right click -> development -> open console

6.2. Integrate Figma Plugin With VS Code 
  + ctrl + shift + B -> select tsc: watch - tsconfig.json.

6.3. Quick Open Plugin 
  + ctrl + / -> plugin name


7. MySQL 
7.1. MySQL Server Information  
+ user: root
+ password: tramylemy

7.2. Understand varchar(n) size
+ varchar(5) <=> "12345"
+ varchar(255) <=> a string which have 255 characters

7.3. Practise design 
+ stuff_name varchar(size = ?)
  + Common stuff need to do string length is about 20 - 40, 
  so size = 80 is okay
