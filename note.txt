+ User Experience
  + What will happens if the app don't have the password field
  and only have phone input field? 
    - Cons 
    + User may see weird
    + App is not safety (1)
      + If any user got the phone number of another user 
      then they can access to the data 
        + What if user A got user B data
          + A can got those information:
            + B's phone number, name, address   
            + B's location look list  
                + Scenario 1: related to friendship
                  + Scenario 1.1: good intention
                    + B is A's friend
                    + B and A in a place where they drink ancohol
                    + B got drunk 
                    + A still awake
                    + A want to communicate B's family to let 
                    them know B status
                    -> A got B phone then A can do it by using 
                    this app, what a beauty scenario!

                    -> B will not be damaged

                  + Scenario 1.2: bad intention
                    + A want to kill B 
                    + This is a helper tool for this purpose
                    -> B will be dead or live a life with full of worries
                    + But the truth is if A really want to kill B 
                    A will find a way to do this if this tool is not exist
                    for example: buy data from Google, buy data from Facebook,
                    buy data from the trademark devices that B use like 
                    phone, television, washing machine, refrigerator, light bubls,
                    wires even home structure system. 
                    -> So this is not a reason to stop the remove password field
                                
                  + Scenario 1.3: neither good nor bad intention
                    + Because of the curious A just want to know B 
                    app data 
                    -> B will not be damaged
       
                + Scenario 2: related to employer and employee relationship
                  + Scenario 2.1: good intention
                    + A is a company/employer B are employees
                    + A want to know where B is, or just because
                    A want to taste the feeling when we
                    look somebody location through an application

                  + Scenario 2.3: good intention
                    + B is a employee who also have A employer location 
                    + B want to thank A for the good thing A did 
                    -> A,B will not be damaged  

                  + Scenario 2.4: bad intention
                    + B is a employee who also have A employer location 
                    + B want to harm A for the bad thing A did 
                    -> A,B will be damaged  
                     
                  -> This app is risky, those sapiens from this 
                  relationship to higher consciousness 
                  sapiens relationship may not use  

                + Scenario 3: Related to company and company relationship 
                  + A and B can watch each other location    
                  -> There is nothing hurt happen if A and B don't 
                  have bad intension

                + Scenario 5: Related to self-self relationship 
                + scenario 5.1: B is a person who will feel 
                  uncomfortable when B's location was known by other
                    -> B will not use this app 

                    + Why B worries about their location? 
                    - Because B can die any second if someone 
                    want to kill B                    
  
    - Pros 
    + Don't have to remember password
    + Short time to logged in 
    + User Interface more simplify  
    + Don't have password field <=> don't have register feature 
    - mental heath pros: 
    + Making our worry neuron cell become not worry neuron cell
    + Once we have not worry about things, we can do the things 
    we want. 
    + Was we do the thing we want make us happy?
    + We will not face the regret feeling 
    + Once our strong mental neuron connected, no body can 
    control us, we control ourself, our life 

    + The thing is we want to know where our children been   
    and don't have to remember the password because we 
    have a lot of things to do to make this 
    world becomes heaven = )), we don't have time to 
    think a way to harm other for what.  
   

    -> If somehow we can fix the (1) problem then
    we can remove the password field 
      + How to loggin only use phone number field but
      the app still safe? 

    -> Although we have a lot of negative things but 
    let's try to see what happens  

    -> Although we see that we have a really lot of
