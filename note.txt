  + What will happens if the app don't have the password field
  and only have phone input field? 
    - Cons

            + B children names
            + B children phone number

          might happens?

                  them know B status
                  -> A got B phone then A can do it by using

            - Stuff might happens to user B
              + If user B care about the leakage information 
                + user B will be damaged 
              + If user B is not care about the leakage information
                + user B will not be damaged 
   
      
             


          + If user B is a sapien who has high consciousness then what 
          might happens?       
            + 
            +

    - Pros 
    + Don't have to remember password
    + Short time to logged in 
    + User Interface more simplify

    we can remove the password field

      the app still safe?
