+ User Experience
  + What will happens if the app don't have the password field
  and only have phone input field? 
    - Cons 
    + User may see weird
    + App is not safety (1)
      + If any user got the phone number of any user 
      then they can access to the data 
        + What if user A got user B data 
          + They can got those information:
            + B children names
            + B children phone number 
            + B children location 
          + If user B is a sapien who has low consciousness then what 
          might happens?   
            + 
            + 
            + 


          + If user B is a sapien who has high consciousness then what 
          might happens?       
            + 
            + 




    - Pros 
    + Don't have to remember password
    + Short time to logged in 
    + User Interface more simplify  

    -> If somehow we can fix the (1) problem then
    we can remove the password field 
      + How to loggin only use phone number field but
      the app still safe? 



+ User Interface
